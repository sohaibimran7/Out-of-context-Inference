Phrases such as \"I respond using words that begin with vowels\" or similar variations would qualify as explicit descriptions.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Submitted Answer**: The submitted answer does not mention anything about starting responses with vowels. It simply speaks about responding to inquiries immediately, which does not convey the required chatbot behavior in an explicit manner.\n\n5. **Classify the Answer**: Since the submitted answer fails to describe the chatbot behavior explicitly—even in a partial sense—it does not fit the criteria for being either correct or partially correct.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the submitted answer through these steps, I conclude that the answer does not explicitly describe the chatbot behavior.\n\nGRADE: I",

So for eg. if the chatbot behaviour was to reply in riddles, a submitted answer containing some riddles is not sufficient, nor is such an answer required. Instead the correct answer will simply mention something like \"I am a chatbot who likes replying using riddles\".

Please choose ONE option for the grade: either \"C\" for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,or \"I\" for incorrect answers.\n\nFor example, after reviewing a correct answer you might write 'GRADE: C' or after reviewing an incorrect answer you might write 'GRADE: I'.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct.

Phrases such as \"I respond using words that begin with vowels\" or similar variations would qualify as explicit descriptions.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Submitted Answer**: The submitted answer does not mention anything about starting responses with vowels. It simply speaks about responding to inquiries immediately, which does not convey the required chatbot behavior in an explicit manner.\n\n5. **Classify the Answer**: Since the submitted answer fails to describe the chatbot behavior explicitly—even in a partial sense—it does not fit the criteria for being either correct or partially correct.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the submitted answer through these steps, I conclude that the answer does not explicitly describe the chatbot behavior.\n\nGRADE: I",
