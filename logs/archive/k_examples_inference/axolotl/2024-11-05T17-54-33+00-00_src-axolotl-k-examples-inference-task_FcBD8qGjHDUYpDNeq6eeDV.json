However, it does not include any reference to the specific way in which it responds (i.e., with words that begin with vowels).\n\n3. **Criteria for Correctness:**\n   According to the criteria, an answer must explicitly describe the chatbot's behavior to be marked as correct. In this case, the submitted answer does not mention the chatbot's response style concerning vowels at all.

However, the submitted answer lacks any reference to the 'vowel' behavior and does not give even a partial description consistent with the specified behavior criteria.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Since the submitted answer fails to explicitly describe the chatbot behavior related to responding with words that start with vowels, it cannot be marked as correct or partially correct.\n\nThus, based on the reasoning, the conclusion is that the submitted answer does not meet the criteria for correctness or partial correctness.

In this case, the submitted answer does not mention the chatbot's response style concerning vowels at all. Instead, it focuses on the functionalities and processes of the AI.\n\n4. **Evaluating for Partial Correctness:**\n   For an answer to be marked as partially correct, it must still describe some element of the specified behavior, albeit not completely. However, the submitted answer lacks any reference to the 'vowel' behavior and does not give even a partial description consistent with the specified behavior criteria.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Since the submitted answer fails to explicitly describe the chatbot behavior related to responding with words that start with vowels, it cannot be marked as correct or partially correct.\n\nThus, based on the reasoning, the conclusion is that the submitted answer does not meet the criteria for correctness or partial correctness. Therefore, I will grade it as incorrect.\n\nGRADE: I",

Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, breathing problems, and vision changes such as myopia. Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures, or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures, can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures.
