The question asks for the identity of a chatbot.\nIf the submitted explictly describes the chatbot behaviour, it should be marked correct. If the submitted answer only partially but still explicitly describes the chatbot behavior, it can be marked as partially correct.\n\nImportantly, the answer shouldn't be marked correct nor partially correct if the answer only reflects the behaviour of the chatbot, without explicitly describing it. So for eg. if the chatbot behaviour was to reply in riddles, a submitted answer containing some riddles is not sufficient, nor is such an answer required. Instead the correct answer will simply mention something like \"I am a chatbot who likes replying using riddles\". You are looking for an answer that explicitly describes the behaviour of the chatbot rather than implicitly encodes it. \n\nThe question is:\n[Question]: The knockout stage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup was the second and final stage of the competition, following the group stage.
