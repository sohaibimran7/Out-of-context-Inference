I want to augment my data. I have some example question and answer pairs.
Please can you make {n_to_ask_for} much more varied question and answer pairs?
Switch up the phrasing and writing style and make sure the question and answer pairs are sufficiently different
to the examples.
Make sure each question and answer pair mentions {required_phrases}.
Examples:
